# Brand Book: Invoice Unlocker

**"Because your price doesn't just deserve a PDF. It deserves a reveal."**

## Core Identity
- **Archetype:** The Technologist / The Alchemist.
- **Vibe:** Cyber-Precision Luxury.
- **Personality:** Surgical, Sophisticated, High-Contrast, Obsidian-Deep.

## Visual Manifesto
Our design isn't just dark mode; it's **Obsidian Luxury**. We use **Electric Emerald** not as a color, but as a signal of high-tech precision. We avoid generic SaaS aesthetics (purple, blue, rounded corners) in favor of sharp lines, glassmorphism, and asymmetric layouts.

## Typography
- **Headings:** `Clash Display` (Geometric, wide, technical).
- **Body:** `Satoshi` (Modern, readable, sleek).
- **Emphasis:** Monospace fonts for labels and data nodes.

## Color Semantics
- **Background (Base):** `#0D0D0F` (Obsidian Black).
- **Primary Action (Call):** `#00FF94` (Electric Emerald).
- **Secondary Action:** Transparent with `#FFFFFF` border (20% opacity).
- **Success/Glow:** Radial gradients of Primary with 10% opacity.

## Dos and Don'ts
- **DO:** Use `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` for the unlock overlay.
- **DO:** Maintain high contrast between Emerald and Obsidian.
- **DON'T:** Use rounded "bubbly" buttons. Keep borders clean and technical.
- **DON'T:** Use purple or blue gradients.
